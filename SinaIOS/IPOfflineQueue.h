// periodically without worrying that a bunch are already in the queue.
//
// With this simple, quick-and-dirty method, you can e.g. delete any existing "get list" requests before
// adding a new one.
//
// But since it does not guarantee that any filtered-out commands won't execute (or finish current executions),
// it should only be used to remove requests that won't have negative side effects if they're still performed,
// such as read-only requests.
